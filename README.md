# 21sh

Third project of Unix -branch in Hive Helsinki.

In progress...

Added features on top of minishell:

Redirections "> >> <" <br>
Aggregations fe. "2>&1 2>&-" <br>
AST execution <br>
Piping "|" <br>
Command separating ";"

Creation of bit more advanced shell intrepeter. <br>
This project is first group project in Unix -branch. <br>
We teamed up with Simo and he is responsible for implementing <br>
termcaps section. <br>
Hardest part was understand AST, lexical analysis and tokenizing <br>
as a concepts. Asking around, watching videos and reading articles <br>
helped to understand how these all connects and works. Once i got <br>
grasp of it, implementing was quite "easy". It wouldn't <br>
be at this point without help from fellow hivers and great Unix <br>
community we have at campus. <br>
