> word 2>&1  == &>word

[n]<word == Redirection of input causes the file whose 
			name results from the expansion of word to be 
			opened for reading on file descriptor n, 
			or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if n is not specified.

[n]>[|]word ==	Redirection of output causes the file whose name 
				results from the expansion of word to be 
				opened for writing on file descriptor n, or the 
				standard output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.
				If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist 
				it is truncated to zero size.

ls -la 2>1  == direct std_err file named 1
ls -la 2>&1 == direct fd 2 to where fd 1 is  pointing
ls -la &>word   == direct std_in and std_out to same fd/file
ls -la 1&>2    == 1 is argument to ls and 2 is file so
				equivalent ls -la 1 &> 2
