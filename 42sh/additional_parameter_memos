--------${parameter:-word}---------
 
 echo ${kyl:-*$f$f$f#$@#@$f}

Since "kyl" is null everything after :- is substituted

 output: *jeejeejee##@jee

If "kyl" isnt null, value of "kyl" will take place
If dash is excluded, error print is:
	bash: kyl: *jeejeejee##@jee: syntax error: invalid arithmetic operator (error token is "##@jee")

--------${parameter:=word}---------

	echo ${kyl:=*$f$f$f#$@#@$f}

Since "kyl" is null everything after := is substituted and setted to "kyl"'s value
	output: *jeejeejee##@jee

If "kyl" isnt null, kyl value is displayed

If "kyl" doesnt exist, it will be created as intern variable with value of *$f$f$f#$@#@$f
	output: *jeejeejee##@jee

--------${parameter:?word}----------

	echo ${kyl:?*$f$f$f#$@#@$f}

if kyl exists and value is null, error print is
	bash: kyl: *jeejeejee##@jee

if kyl exists and value isnt null print is kyl value

if kyl is null or unset and after :? isnt anything output is
	bash: kyl: parameter null or not set

--------${parameter:+word}----------

	echo ${kyl:+*$f$f$f#$@#@$f}

If kyl is null or unset, nothing is substituted
otherwise value of +*$f$f$f#$@#@$f is substituted
